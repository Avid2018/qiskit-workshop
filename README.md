# qiskit-workshop

This repo contains the jupyter notebook for my Getting Started with Quantum Computing and Qiskit workshop. It walks
through the basics of quantum computing by using Qiskit.

## Using the notebook

### Running locally
To work through the workshop locally this depends on having both `jupyter` and `matplotlib` installed. In addition
you'll need Qiskit installed (although the first cell in the notebook shows how install this from inside jupyter).

### Running on a hosted jupyter service.

There are several hosted jupyter services that you can run the workshop
through. Google's colab service has been setup with this so you can go to:

To run the latest version of this workshop without needing to install any software locally.
